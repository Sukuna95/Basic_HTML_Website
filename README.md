# Basic_HTML_Website

I've created Basic HTML Website as a roadmap.sh frontend project.

I've created the simple home page without much CSS and responsive but all other pages are responsive.
You can just copy and paste these code on VSCode or any other IDE and run. Remember to add your details in it.
